# OER-DIGITAL-TWINS 
This repository contains the tutorial "DIGITAL TWINS" which is available for reuse as an Open Educational Resorce (OER). A digital twin is a virtual replica or representation of a physical system such as a city, building, machine etc. It replicates the characteristics, state and behavior of the physical system in real-time, and it is updated using real-time data.

In this tutorial, you will learn: 

- The various components that make up a digital twin
- Some application areas of digital twins
- How digital twins differ from simulations, 3D models, and GIS systems
- How to use CesiumJS, Cesium ION and real-time environmental data to create a simple digital twin for Hamburg
- How to use Docker to start up the digital twins application

### Target Audience and Prerequisites
This tutorial is designed for students and professionals who want to improve their understanding of Spatial Information Infrastructures, and in particular, learning more about the concept of Digital Twins. No prerequisite knowledge or skills is needed to use this tutorial. Knowledge on Docker would be helpful, but is not absolutely necessary as this tutorial will guide you through the various steps of working with Docker.

### How to use the OER module


### Authors and Funding
This OER module has been developed at the Institute for Geoinformatics (IFGI), University of Münster, in collaboration with 52°North GmbH. Authors are James Ondieki, Simon Jirka and Albert Remke.
