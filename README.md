# OER-DIGITAL-TWINS 
This repository contains the tutorial "DIGITAL TWINS" which is available for reuse as an Open Educational Resorce (OER). A digital twin is a virtual replica or representation of a physical system such as a city, building, machine etc. It replicates the characteristics, state and behavior of the physical system in real-time, and it is updated using real-time data.

In this tutorial, you will learn: 

- The various components that make up a digital twin
- Some application areas of digital twins
- How digital twins differ from simulations, 3D models, and GIS systems
- How to use CesiumJS, Cesium ION and real-time environmental data to create a simple digital twin for Hamburg
- How to use Docker to start up the digital twins application

##### This tutorial is structured as follows:

- Overview
- Background
	- The idea of Digital Twins
	- Components of a Digital Twin
	- What is so special about Digital Twins
	- Application Areas of Digital Twins
  - Case study - Hamburg City's Digital Twin Initiatives 
- Practical Exercises
	- Setting Up the Digital Twins application
  - Exploring the Digital Twins application
      - Air quality at different locations
      - Flood Simulation
      - Visualize a Proposed Building
- Summary and Discussion
- References

### Target Audience and Prerequisites
This tutorial is designed for students and professionals who want to improve their understanding of Spatial Information Infrastructures, and in particular, learning more about the concept of Digital Twins. This tutorial requires some basic knowledge of geodata and geographic information systems. Knowledge on Docker would be helpful, but is not absolutely necessary as this tutorial will guide you through the various steps of working with Docker.

You will need about 90 minutes to work through this tutorial. 

### How to use the OER module
